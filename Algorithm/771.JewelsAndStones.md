## Algorithm
### Jewels and Stones
* Description		
	* J = "aA"  S = "aAAbbbbb"

	You're given strings ``J`` representing the types of stones that are jewels,and ``S``representing the stones you have.Each character in ``S`` is  a type of stone you have.You want to know how many of the stones you have also jewels.
	
	The letters in ``J`` are guaranteed distinct,and all characters in ``J`` and ``S`` are letters.Letters are case sensitive,so ``"a"`` is considered a different type of stone from ``"A"``.
	
		guaranteed 保证
		distinct 明显的，确切的，清楚的
	Note:
	
	``S`` and ``J`` will consist of letters and have length at most 50
	
	The characters in ``J`` are distinct.
	
	* solution 1
	
		```
		def numJewelsInStones(J, S):
		    sDict = {}
		    for s in S:
		        if sDict.get(s, None) == None:
		            sDict[s] = 1
		        else:
		            sDict[s] = sDict.get(s) + 1
		    num = 0
		    for j in J:
		        if sDict.get(j,None) != None:
		            num = num + sDict.get(j)
		    return num
		```
		
	* solution 2
			
		```
		def numJewelsInStones(J, S):
		    num = 0
		    for x in S:
		        if x in J:
		            num += 1
		    return num
		```
		
	* solution 3
			
		```
		def numJewelsInStones(J,S):
			return sum(s in J for s in S)
		```
		
	* 总结：考察的还是对语言语法的掌握，怎么用最少的代码解决问题
